# HomeWork #2

## 
This assignment is about getting hands on some encrypting algorithms like RSA and working with its library. It is also an introduction to blockchain and getting a grasp of hashing and nonce on how they work.

## Structure

This homework consists of four files all in one directory: rsa.py, block.py, requirements.txt, readme.md.


## Installation

Create a virtual environment, then use the python package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the requirements.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the script

Make sure to open your console and source in the virtual environment.
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
Open the console in the project directory, then run the each script and interact as it instructs.

`python rsa.py`
`python block.py`
