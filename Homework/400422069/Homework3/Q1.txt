- What are pure functions?

Pure function doesn't read or modify the state variables.
It can only use local variables that are declared in the function, 
and the arguments that are passed to the function to compute or return a value.


- When can we declare a pure function?
When we only want to do some computational that doesn't change the state and use any external data to obtain the return value.
pure fubction always returns the same result if the same arguments are passed. It does not depend on any state or data change during a program's execution, 

They can use the revert() and require() functions to revert potential state changes if an error occurs.

- Difference between a pure and a view function?
View functions are read only functions and do not modify the state of the block chain. 
In other words if you want to read data from the block chain one can use view.

Pure function declares that no state variable will be changed or read. 
view tells us that by running the function, no data will be saved/changed.
pure tells us that not only does the function not save any data to the blockchain, but it also doesn't read any data from the blockchain.


- Example of a pure function.

contract pureSample {
   function getResult() public pure returns(uint sum){
      uint a = 5; 
      uint b = 7;
      sum = a + b; 
   }
}


- What are function modifiers?

Function modifier can be used to automatically check the condition prior to executing the function.
Function modifier can be executed before or after the function executes its code.
The modifiers can be used when there is a need to verify the condition automatically before executing a particular function.
If the given condition is not satisfied, then the function will not get executed.
