### what is pure?

In functions that do not read any variable
from the smart contract or change any variable,
it is called a pure function.
Only local variables are defined in it.
There is no fee to call these functions.


### When can we call a function pure?
When the function only uses the local variables declared
in the function and does not read or change anything from
the smart contract parameters.


### What is the difference between Pure and View?
In the View function,
in addition to the local variables,
we can read the variables in the smart contract,
but we cannot change them.
