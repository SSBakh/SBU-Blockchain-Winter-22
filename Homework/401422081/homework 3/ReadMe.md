This homework is name "colored wallet"

I created wallet dataset using map. After sending blue coins or converting to red ones it is saved back to the map dataset. 

I provided explaination and an example of pure function in code. Pure function is a function that does't change smart contracs state. 

I created a modifier to check if user has registered in colored wallet and used in sending coins and converting blue coins to red coins.
