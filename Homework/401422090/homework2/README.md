## Setup venv
* `python3 -m venv development`
* `source development/bin/activate`
* `pip3 install --upgrade pip`

## Install dependencies
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Run tests
As I wrote automatic tests, you can check that [file](./src/main_test.py) to see 
how the functions work, although I tried my best to function names
be clear and codes be self documented, for see whether my codes work
properly or not you can run test cases

`python3 src/main_test.py`

**PS** It almost takes 10-20 seconds to pass tests on my computer
