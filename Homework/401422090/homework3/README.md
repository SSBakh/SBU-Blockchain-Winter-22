## Question 1
### What is pure function?
A function that doesn't read or modify the variables of the state is called a pure function. It can only use local variables that are declared in the function and the arguments that are passed to the function to compute or return a value.

### When can we make a function pure?
When we dont want to read/write something in state

### Pure function vs View functions?
View function declares that no state will be changed.Pure function declares that no state variable will be changed or read.

**So in View function you can read from state but in pure function you can't do it**
