# first python program 

we have 2 scripts here.

  
## 1. First Script
in this script we have a sweet interface with plenty of comments that helps you with understanding it.
you have 4 options.
 ### A. generates a pair of private and public keys.
 ### B. signs a message with the private key. notice that we create a 20 letters string by ourselves and if you want to  change that, listen to instructions that inteface gives you.
 ### C. checks the Signature.
 ### D. exit!

## 2. Second Script
in this one we simply mine a block. we use SHA256 Algorithm.
in this one we have an interface that lets you to choose whether you want to go with cryptography library or the hashlib (built in) library.
the hashlib works like magic but the cryptography tests your patience.

the requirements are not too many and you can find them in the requirements.txt file.
