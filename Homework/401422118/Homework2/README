Creating Virtual Environments
>>> python3 -m venv .venv

Once youâ€™ve created a virtual environment, you may activate it.
On Windows, run:
>>> .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
On Unix or MacOS, run:
>>> source .venv/bin/activate

The requirements.txt can then be committed to version control and transferred as part of an application. Users can then install all the necessary packages with install -r:
>>> pip install -r requirements.txt

After install requirements.txt you can run main1.py:
>>> python3 main1.py

GeneratePairKeys()
It gives us 2 keys, private key and public key. Both of them are generated by RSA encoding algorithm


SignMessage("private.pem", "Hello World")
It takes the message(Hello World) and private key(./private.pem) and will create sign file.


VerifySignMessage("Hello World", "public.pem", "sign")
It takes public key(./public.pem), message(Hello World), and signiture(./sign) and as a respond, it verifies or disqulaifies the message
