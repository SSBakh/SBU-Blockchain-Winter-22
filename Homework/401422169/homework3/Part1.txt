What are pure functions?
	A function that doesnâ€™t read or modify the variables of the state
	is called a pure function.

When we can use them?
	We can declare a pure function when we want to use local variables that are declared
	in the function and the arguments that are passed to the function to compute or return a value.

What is difference between pure and view functions?
	View functions are read only function and do not modify the state of the block chain (view data on the block chain).
	pure functions do not read and do not modify state of the block chain. All the data the pure function is concerned
	with is either passed in or defined in the functions scope.

Example of pure function:
	pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

	contract pureSample {

   		function sumOfTwoNumbers() public pure returns(uint sum){
      		uint a = 20; 
      		uint b = 30;
      		sum = a + b; 
   		}
	}

Simple diagram for pure functions:

NOTE1:
	If the pure function is doing any of the following,
	the compiler will consider them as reading state
	variables and will throw a warning:

		1.Reading state variables
		2.Accessing balance or address
		3.Invoking a function that is not pure
		4.Accessing a global variable, message, or block
		5.Using certain opcodes in inline assembly

NOTE2:
	If the pure function is doing any of the following,
	the compiler will consider them as modifying state
	variables and will throw a warning:

		1.Modifying or over-writing state variables
		2.Creating new contracts
		3.Invoking a function that is not pure or view
		4.Emitting events
		5.Using certain opcodes in inline assembly
		6.Using selfdestruct
		7.Using low-level function calls
		8.Sending Ether along with function calls

NOTE3:
	Pure functions are allowed to use the revert() and require() functions.
