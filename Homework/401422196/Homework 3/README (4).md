this is my answer to the assignment number 3 
#section 1 
### what are pure functions ?
pure function can not read or write to the state variables
Pure functions can use the revert() and require() functions to revert potential state changes if an error occurs.
### When we call a function pure in solidity?
In Solidity, a function that doesnâ€™t read or modify the variables of the state is called a pure function. It can only use local variables that are declared in the function and the arguments that are passed to the function to compute or return a value.
### what are the differences between Pure and View functions ?
the main difference is that In view function, we cannot modify state variable whereas in pure we also cannot modify state and also we canâ€™t read state variable. Let's see the example code.
### write an example for the pure function 

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Test {
   function getResult() public pure returns(uint product, uint sum){
      uint a = 1; 
      uint b = 2;
      product = a * b;
      sum = a + b; 
   }
}
```
