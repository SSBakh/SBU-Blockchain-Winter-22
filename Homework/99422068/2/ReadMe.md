## Submission Instructions

For your homework submission to be considered valid, you must create a pull request with your work. 
> Your homework will be visible to everyone and anyone who views your profile. 

If you're not familiar with Git and GitHub, I **highly** recommend taking the time to check out [this 1 hour video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk) or, if you don't have the time, [this 15 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjZcfj8yxE) (*or* if you don't have the time for **that** either, [this 2 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ReR1YJrNOM)), **as it's assumed you (the student) at the very least are familiar with the basics of git.**

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Click the **Fork** button at the top right of this page and create a fork.

2. Now that you've forked this repository, clone it, and create a folder in the `Homework` folder with the same name as your student ID (for example, the path of the new folder would be `/Homework/[Student ID]`).

- [YouTube: How to clone a GitHub repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKcqniGu3tA)
- [How to create a folder in a GitHub repository](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12258399/how-do-i-create-a-folder-in-a-github-repository)


3. Then, make another folder in the folder you've just made indicating which session's homework you're turning in. For instance, if you're turning in session 2's homework, you'd make a folder named `session2` or `homework2`.
- Please try to keep your naming conventions consistent through the duration of the semester. :)

4. Inside this folder is where you'll put your homework submission. As stated, your submission **must** have a .md file (such as ReadMe.md), or else it **will not be counted as valid**.

5. Then, commit your changes **on a new branch**. This branch should have the same name as your student ID. For instance, if you're using GitHub's UI to upload your submission folder/files, if your student ID was 123456789, it would look something like this:

6. Then, when you've uploaded your submission on a branch, open a pull request. You can find the button on your repo's main page:

Fill out the relevant fields, and create a pull request. Then, you're done!

## Important Details
- Pull requests will be merged at most 48 hours after submission deadline.
- If there are any serious issues, your pull request may be rejected. You will have 48 hours after the request was rejected to make any relevant changes and submit your work again. It is up to **you** to check and see if your work was accepted.
- If your pull request has been accepted, assume that there were no issues and that your homework was submitted successfully.
- All pull requests 2 hours after deadline are automatically rejected.
